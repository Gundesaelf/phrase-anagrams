# Phrase Anagrams

Phrase Anagrams is an interactive Python application that allows users to construct custom anagram phrases from any given name. The program loads a dictionary of words and, based on the letters in the entered name, presents a filtered list of valid words. Users iteratively select words to build a complete anagram phrase, with the program tracking remaining letters and dynamically updating available options. The interface uses color-coded terminal output for clarity, and users can restart or exit at any point.

This project demonstrates Python skills in text processing, user input handling, and command-line interface design. It showcases the use of data structures such as `collections.Counter` to efficiently manage letter availability, and it emphasizes clean, interactive program flow.
